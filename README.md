# guess_game
Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a fun and beginner-friendly project built with Python! This game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, providing feedback after each guess. It’s a perfect starter project to strengthen your Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions, and input/output operations.
This is a simple console-based game built with Python where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback — whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. It also keeps track of the number of attempts taken to guess the right number.
##Project Overview
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player must guess the number, and after each guess, the program will indicate whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and it also displays the total number of attempts taken.
##This project is an excellent practice tool for:
- Understanding the use of Python’s built-in modules like 'random'
- Handling user input and validating it
- Implementing loops and conditionals
- Writing clean, readable, and interactive command-line applications
##Features
- Random number generation from 1 to 100
- User input validation with error handling
- Descriptive hints after each guess
- Keeps count of the number of attempts
- Clean and minimal console interface
- Easy to extend with additional features

##Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
